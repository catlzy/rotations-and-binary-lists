# Rotations and Binary Lists in Prolog
This repository contains Prolog files for relations about binary lists and rotation of lists. 


Relations in `rotate.pl` contains: 
* Rotate a list one time to the right
* Rotate a list N times to the right
* Determine if two lists are rotations of each other
* Find all rotations of a given list
* Find the necklace of a given list - a list that is in its smallest rotation with respect to lexicographic (i.e. alphabetical) order


Relations in `binary.pl` contains:
* Determine if a list only contains binary numbers
* Determine if a list of a given length only contains binary numbers
* Find all binary lists of a given length
